## Introduction
The U-Net architecture is widely used for image segmentation tasks, particularly in medical imaging and object detection. This repository demonstrates how to load data, preprocess images, train the U-Net model, and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
You can install the required packages using pip: 
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy scikit-learn
## Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/username/unet-image-segmentation.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd unet-image-segmentation
Prepare your dataset:

Place your input images in the input_dir directory.
Place corresponding segmented images in the output_dir directory.
Update the input_dir, output_dir, and image_size parameters in the unet_image_segmentation.py file according to your dataset.

## Run the training script:

python unet_image_segmentation.py
After training, the script will output training and testing metrics, as well as visually demonstrate segmentation on test images.
Results
The trained U-Net model achieves high accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores on both training and testing sets. Sample results and segmented images can be found in the results directory.
